## Introduction

JT harness is based on Oracle\'s JavaTest harness. The JT harness is a general purpose,
fully-featured, flexible, and configurable test harness very well suited for most types of unit
testing. Originally developed as a test harness to run TCK test suites, it has since evolved into a
general purpose test platform.

The JT harness:

-   Is designed to configure, sequence, and run test suites that consist of many (100,000 or more)
    discrete, independent tests. It is especially good at testing APIs and compilers.
-   Can be used to run tests on all of the Java platforms, from the Java Card platform, to the Java
    Platform, Enterprise Edition (\"Java EE\").
-   Enables you to create test suites that are self-contained products that customers can easily
    configure and run.

We encourage you to try JT harness, participate in the
[community](http://java.net/projects/jtharness), and contribute to further development.

JT harness BUILD_VERSION is a feature release that adds selected functionality as well as fixing
existing issues in many areas. For a detailed report, see [Bugs Fixed in Release
BUILD_VERSION](#fixed_general). This binary release contains a built version of the JT harness
(`lib/javatest.jar`) and a tutorial that introduces you to the JT harness graphical user interface.

[]{#run}\

## Run JT Harness 

Run the JT harness using the following command:

**`% java -jar javatest.jar`**

**Note:** Typically, a user executes JT harness in the context of a test suite. Read the tutorial
documentation for instructions about how to execute JT harness with the tutorial example test suite.

[]{#secnote}

## Important Security Note

NOTE: Be sure to read the Important Security Information chapter in the online help.

### Removing Optional Files

In principle, every file you install poses a potential security risk. After installing the harness,
you can reduce risk by removing files you do not need.

To run the harness, you must minimally have one of two sets of files:

1.  `lib/javatest.jar`: This archive is the test harness. It requires the file `lib/jh.jar` to
    display online help.
2.  `lib/jtlite.jar`: This archive is the lite harness.

You can delete the following installed files and directories if you do not want to use them:

-   `examples/`. This directory contains (in the `tutorials/` subdirectory) the JavaTest tutorial
    (`tutorial.html`) and related files. \[#tutorial\] describes how to run the tutorial. You can
    delete this directory.
-   `lib/`.
    -   You can delete `jt-unit.jar` if you do not want to run Junit tests with the harness. You can
        learn about Junit at <http://junit.sourceforge.net/>.
    -   You can delete the harness version you do not use, either `jtlite.jar` or `javatest.jar`. If
        you delete `javatest.jar`, you can also delete `jh.jar`.

A test suite includes many additional files. Refer to your test suite's documentation to see which
files are optional.

### Restricting Access to Installed Files

Limiting access to installed harness files minimizes the chance of file corruption. You can restrict
acesss to installed harness files by setting their permissions to read-only for the user who runs
the harness. Write or execute permission is not required for any installed harness file. You can
deny all access to people who do not run the harness.

## About This Release

[]{#secjava7}

## Security Exceptions With Java 7 on Windows

When using Java 7 on Windows, the harness might experience problems executing particular parts of
the Java 7 APIs because, by default, the harness security manager denies access to certain
properties. The problem might manifest as one of the [Known Exceptions](#knownexcept) reproduced
below (see [java.io.IOException](#knownexceptio) and [Socket Exception Error](#knownexceptsocket)).

There are ways to workaround the security exceptions:

1.  **Set the `javatest.security.allowPropertiesAccess` system property to `"true"` at startup.**
    The harness security manager (JavaTestSecurityManager) is automatically installed at startup,
    and its default settings deny access to the System Properties object. You can manually allow
    access to harness properties as follows:

    `java -Djavatest.security.allowPropertiesAccess=true ...`

2.  **Enable and disable property access programatically.** The following code temporarily allows
    properties access until after the code in the `try` block is executed. Beware of race conditions
    when using this code.

                SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
                JavaTestSecurityManager jtSm = null;
                boolean prev = false;
                if (sm != null && sm instanceof JavaTestSecurityManager) {
                    jtSm = (JavaTestSecurityManager) sm;
                    prev = jtSm.setAllowPropertiesAccess(true);
                }
                try {
                    // execute exception causing actions here
                } finally {
                    if (jtSm != null) {
                        jtSm.setAllowPropertiesAccess(prev);
                    }
                }

test runs, and extended the Quick Pick execution to include Tests to Run settings in configurations.
This behavior is controlled by preference settings.

Version 4.3 included the following major features:

-   The tabbed window style is the only window mode. MDI and SDI window modes were removed.
-   GUI colors became partially configurable in the Preferences dialog. Other settings are still
    available via command line.
-   Service startup information was enhanced to show progress.
-   Saving of previous desktop is now disabled by default (was enabled previous to this release).
-   Usability was improved in the main test tree. Added selection and right-click actions to choose
    from a context menu.

Version 4.4 was a feature release. In addition to fixing bugs, it introduced Known Failures Lists
and refined the exclude list feature to support case sensitivity.

Version 4.4.1 was a bug fix release.

[]{#usage_notes}

### Usage Notes

This section discusses features that are working properly but have limitations due to factors JT
Harness can\'t control.

#### Printing Pages from the Online Help and Test Reports

Because of the method the Java SE platform uses to render fonts, when you print a document from the
harness user interface, the fonts in the printed documents are larger than they are when rendered on
the screen.

The JT Harness User\'s Guide has been provided in PDF form for your use in printing pages from the
documents. While the online help viewer supports printing operations, in some cases you may be
unable to use it to print a specific page. If this occurs, use the PDF version of the appropriate
User\'s Guide to print the page. Printing of non-HTML report types is not supported. Users are
informed of this when they attempt to print a non-HTML report type. Support will be added for this
in a future release.

[Top ![go to TOC](doc/shared/topicon.gif)](#top)

#### Changing Status Colors in the GUI

JT Harness allows you to specify the status colors used in the GUI. See the online help for detailed
information about changing the default status colors.

#### Agent Monitor Tool

The Agent Monitor tool may not apply to all test suites, even if the test suite uses an agent. See
your test suite documentation for detailed information about the agent that it uses and its use of
the Agent Monitor tool.
