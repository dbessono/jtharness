# Stopping a Test Run

When the harness is running tests, it enables both the ![Stop Test Run button displayed on the tool
bar](../../images/stopTests_button.gif){longdesc="stopping.html"}   button on the toolbar and the
Stop menu item.

Either click the ![Stop Test Run button displayed on the tool
bar](../../images/stopTests_button.gif){longdesc="stopping.html"}   button or choose Run Tests `>`
Stop to stop a test run.

As it completes each test, the harness writes the test results (`.jtr` files) in the work directory.
Stopping a test run causes the tests in progress to indicate an error.

When you stop a test run, the harness does not generate reports of test results. You must generate
the reports from the Test Manager window or from the command line. See [Creating and Displaying
Reports](../report/usingReports.html) for detailed information about test reports.
