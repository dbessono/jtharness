# [Using View Filters]{#filterEditor}

In the toolbar at the top of the test tree is a list of view filters that you can use to select the
status of the folders and tests displayed by the test tree. The harness includes a Current
Configuration filter and an All Tests filter. Additional filters, such as certification filters, can
also be added by the test suite. Refer to your test suite documentation for detailed descriptions of
any additional filters in the list of view filters.

Selecting a view filter only filters the status (folder colors and counters) displayed in the Test
Manager window, not the tests that are run. You must use the configuration editor to filter the
tests that are run. See [Specifying Tests to Run](../confEdit/initialFiles.html).

See[View Filters](../browse/viewFilters.html) for detailed information about the view filters
available in the Test Manager.
