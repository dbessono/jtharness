# Running Tests

In the Test Manager, you can use the Run Tests menu or the toolbar button to start a test run of the
tests specified in your current configuration. See [Test Manager Tool](../ui/window.html) for a
description of the Run Tests menu and the tool bar buttons. See [Configuring a Test
Run](../confEdit/overview.html) for a description of how to use the Configuration Editor to specify
configuration information used to run tests.

You can also use the test tree pop-up menu to start a test run of one or more tests selected from
the test tree. See [Test Tree Pop-up Menu](../ui/popupmenu.html) for a description of how to use the
test tree pop-up menu to run individual tests in a test tree.

If you do not want to use the Test Manager to run tests, you can use the command line. See
[Command-Line Summary](../command/commandLine.html) in the *Command-Line Interface User\'s Guide*
for information about running tests from the command line.

The harness saves all test results after running tests but does not automatically generate reports
of test results. You must generate test reports from the Test Manager or from the command line. See
[Generating and Viewing Reports](../report/usingReports.html) for detailed information about
reports.

If you use the All Tests view filter and begin a test run, the harness displays an advisory dialog
box. Using the All Test view filter displays the results of all tests in a test suite regardless of
whether or not they are included in the test run.

You can choose to disable the dialog box by setting harness Preferences, by choosing a different
view filter, or by using the check box in the dialog to stop the dialog from being displayed in the
future.
