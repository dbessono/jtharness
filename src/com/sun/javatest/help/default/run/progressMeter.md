# Progress Indicator

The progress indicator located at the bottom of the Information Area displays the elapsed time of
the previous test run when tests are not running. When tests are running, it automatically changes
to the progress bar of the current test run. At the completion of the test run, the indicator
changes to display the elapsed time.

You can use the ![drop-down list button](../../images/drop-down.gif){longdesc="progressMeter.html"}
button at any time to select and display either the elapsed time or the progress bar.

[]{#progressMeter.time}

## Elapsed Time

When a test run starts, the elapsed time display resets to 00.00.00. At the end of the test run, the
total elapsed time for the test run is displayed.

[]{#progressMeter.bar}

## Progress Bar

The harness displays a progress bar and a percentage complete value. As the harness completes a
test, it updates the progress bar and the percentage complete value.
