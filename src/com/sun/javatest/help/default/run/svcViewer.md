# Monitoring Services

The Service Monitor displays the status of a test suite\'s services and provides a way to start or
stop each service. See your test suite documentation for detailed information about the services it
uses.

To open the Service Monitor, select View \> Services. To change a service\'s status, select its row
and click Start or Stop. If the test suite generates logs, the logs might display information on
service events. The figure below shows a test suite with two services, as seen in the Service
Monitor. The Log Viewer displays critical messages corresponding to each service.

See [Log Viewer](../ui/logViewer.html) for a detailed description of the Log Viewer.
