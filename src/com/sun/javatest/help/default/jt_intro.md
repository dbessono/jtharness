# Introduction

The online User\'s Guide contains information about using the graphical user interface (GUI), the
command-line interface, the harness utilities, and the optional JT harness agent (when it is
included by the test suite). The online User\'s Guide provides a glossary, an index, and a search
function that enables the user to locate any word or phrase used in the User\'s Guides.

Users can display the User\'s Guide with or without starting the GUI. To display the User\'s Guide
without starting the GUI, type the following command from the directory where the `javatest.jar`
file is located:

`java -jar javatest.jar -userGuide`

## ![The following text is a heading](../images/closedbook.gif){longdesc="jt_intro.html"}Graphical User Interface

This section describes how the GUI enables the user to:

-   Configure, run, and monitor tests.
-   Create templates.
-   Use the Quick Start to set up and run tests.
-   Generate and view test reports.
-   Monitor agents (Optional).

## ![The following text is a heading](../images/closedbook.gif){longdesc="jt_intro.html"} Command-Line Interface

This section describes how the command-line interface enables the user to:

-   Configure, run, and monitor tests.
-   Generate and view test reports.
-   Run tests in build scripts and other automated processes.
-   Start the GUI in a specified configuration.

## ![The following text is a heading](../images/closedbook.gif){longdesc="jt_intro.html"} Utilities

This section describes how the utilities provided by the harness allow a user to perform the
following basic tasks without starting the GUI:

-   Remotely monitor results with an HTTP server.
-   Browse result files.
-   Browse exclude list files.
-   Edit entries in a configuration file.
-   Move test reports.

## ![The following text is a heading](../images/closedbook.gif){longdesc="jt_intro.html"} Optional JT Harness Agent

The harness provides an optional agent that you can use when running test suites on small systems.
In some cases, users might understand the term *agent* as including software components which are
not part of the harness. However, in this documentation, the term *agent* refers to the JT Harness
agent. If a test suite uses this agent, the test suite might also include the agent user\'s guide in
the harness.
