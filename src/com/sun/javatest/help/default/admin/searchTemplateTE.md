# Using Template Search

When using the Template Editor in Question Mode, you can locate and display the panes containing a
specific character string by choosing Search \> Find. The Find Question dialog box is used in
locating and displaying a specified character string.

The editor can search titles, questions, and answers for matching characters. It does not search the
More Info.
