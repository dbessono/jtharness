# Editing Keywords and Expressions {#editing-keywords-and-expressions .proc}

![This is the start of a procedure](../../images/hg_proc.gif){longdesc="keywordsTabTE.html"} To edit
keywords and keyword expressions in the template, perform the following steps:

1.  Choose View \> Quick Set Mode from the Template Editor menu bar.
2.  Click the Keywords tab in the Template Editor.\
    \
    The JT harness displays this tab only if your test suite uses keywords.

![Keywords pane from the Template Editor](../../images/JT4keywordTabConfigEd.gif){border="0"
longdesc="keywordsTabTE.html"}

3.  Use the Expression, Insert Operator, and Insert Keyword buttons to build an expression in the
    text field by using any logical combination of the following actions:
    -   Click the Expression button to display a list of expressions that can be constructed. From
        the list, choose the type of expression that you are building.

    -   Click the Insert Keyword button to display the list of keywords provided by the test suite
        for use in filtering tests (this is only available if the test suite has information). From
        the list, choose the keywords used in the expression.

    -   Click the Insert Operator button to display a list of operators that you can use to
        construct boolean expressions in the text field. From the list, choose the operator used in
        the expression.\
        \
        See Keyword Expressions for descriptions and examples of keyword expressions that can be
        constructed.

The following table provides descriptions and examples of keyword expressions that can be
constructed.

## List of Logical Operators

Logical operators are only available when Expression is selected in the list of expressions. The
following table provides descriptions and examples of logical operators that can be used to build
keyword expressions. The precedence column indicates the order in which the expression is resolved.
Expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, with nested parentheses being evaluated from the
innermost parentheses outward.
