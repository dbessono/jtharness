# Setting Bookmarks

You can use Bookmarks to restrict the set of questions displayed when a user loads the template in a
Configuration Editor. This feature enables you to reduce the visible length and complexity of a
configuration interview by only displaying the questions that a user must answer before running
tests.

Bookmarks are persistent and are saved in the `.jtm` file. If bookmarks are disabled by a user, they
remain in program memory but cannot be manipulated.
