## Exclude List Pane

Use the following to change the exclude list used to run tests:

-   **None** - An Exclude List is not used.
-   **Initial** - Only enabled if the test suite provides an exclude list. If you choose Initial,
    the tests are run using the exclude list provided by the test suite.
-   **Latest** - Only enabled if the test suite provides a location for updated exclude lists. If
    you choose Latest, additional options are displayed. See [Latest Exclude
    List](#excludeList.latestTE) below for detailed information.
-   **Other** - A custom exclude list can be used. See [Other Exclude List](#excludeList.otherTE)
    below for detailed information.

If a complete test is added to the exclude list, the harness updates the test result status without
requiring the test be rerun. However, if only a test case from a test is added to the exclude list,
the harness requires that you rerun the test using the updated exclude list before updating the test
result status.

## Latest Exclude List

If your test suite provides a URL for the latest test suite, the harness enables the Latest exclude
list option. The following table describes the text and controls displayed when you choose the
Latest exclude list option.

  Text and Controls                 Description
  --------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Location                          Displays the location of the exclude list specified by the test suite. This is a non-editable field.
  Last updated                      Displays the date that the exclude list was last updated. This is a non-editable field.
  Check For Updates Automatically   Causes the harness to automatically check the location of the exclude list and compare the date-time stamps of the remote and local exclude lists. The harness then displays a dialog box advising you of the results. If a new exclude list is available, you can choose to download it.
  Every \_ Days                     Sets an interval for the harness to automatically check the remote location of the exclude list for updates.
  Every Test Run                    Causes the harness to check the remote location of the exclude list for updates before each test run.
  Check Now                         Causes the harness to check the remote location of the exclude list for an update.
