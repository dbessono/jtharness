# Quick Set Mode

Quick Set Mode uses tabbed panes to display only the runtime values of a template.

Runtime values are used to choose the tests that are run and specify how tests are run. These values
can change from test run to test run. Quick Set Mode displays only the runtime values that apply to
your test suite.The tabs containing runtime values that do not apply to your test suite are not
displayed in Quick Set Mode.

-   [Keywords](../admin/keywordsTabTE.html) (optional)
-   [Prior Status](../admin/statusTabTE.html)
-   [Environment](../admin/envTabTE.html) (optional)
-   [Execution](../admin/execTabTE.html) (optional)

Quick Set Mode is not enabled until a template is either loaded or started in the Template Editor.
See [Editing a Template](../admin/editTemplate.html) for detailed information about editing a
