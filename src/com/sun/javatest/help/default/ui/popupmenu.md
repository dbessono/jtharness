# Test Tree Pop-Up Menu

The test tree provides a pop-up menu. Displaying the pop-up menu for a folder or test is a
platform-specific operation (such as right clicking the folder or test icon in the test tree). You
can also press Shift-F10 to display the pop-up menu for the test with focus.

![Test Tree popup menu](../../images/popupMenu.gif){border="0" longdesc="popupmenu.html"}

The pop-up menu contains the following menu items:

-   **Execute these tests** - See [Quick Pick Test Execution](#popupMenu.execute) for a detailed
    description.
-   **Refresh** - See [Refresh Test Suite Contents](#popupMenu.refresh) for a detailed description.
-   **Clear Results** - See [Clear Previous Test Results](#popupMenu.clear) for a detailed
    description.

The harness does not allow you to perform operations using the pop-up menu when it is running tests.
The harness displays an error dialog box if you attempt to perform an operation using the pop-up
menu when tests are running.

See [Keyboard access](../ui/keyboardAccess.html) for a description of how you can use the keyboard
to open and navigate the pop-up menu.

[]{#popupMenu.execute}

## Quick Pick Test Execution

You can use the Execute these tests menu item to run the tests and folders highlighted in the test
tree, subject to filters such as keywords.

The harness does not automatically perform a refresh operation before running the tests. If changes
are made to a test suite, you must perform a refresh before running tests. See [Refresh Test Suite
Contents](#popupMenu.refresh) for a description of the refresh operation.

### Quick Pick Test Execution of Specific Folders or Tests {#quick-pick-test-execution-of-specific-folders-or-tests .proc}

1.  Select one or more folders and tests in the test tree.

> -   You must left click to select nodes. When more than one folder or test is highlighted in the
>     test tree, the Test Manager displays a list of the selected tests and folders in the
>     information area.
> -   Selecting a test executes only that test.
> -   Selecting a folder executes all tests currently known to the Test Manager in and below that
>     folder.

2.  Right click in the test tree pane to open the pop-up menu.

> Opening the pop-up menu is a platform-specific operation (such as right clicking in the test tree
> pane). A modifier key or operation which doesn\'t utilize the clicking at all may be necessary
> depending on your platform details.

3.  Choose Execute these tests from the test tree pop-up menu.

> -   If the Test Manager contains a completed configuration, the harness displays a message to
>     confirm the execute operation.
> -   If the Test Manager does not contain a completed configuration, the harness displays a message
>     asking you to complete the configuration or cancel the test run.
>
> ![The following text is a note](../../images/hg_note.gif)\
> The harness combines the [current configuration](currentConfiguration.html) and the nodes selected
> in the test tree to determine which tests will be executed. In the [Test Manager
> Preferences](testManager.html), the option \"Execution from tree popup includes configuration
> Tests to Run\" how the harness uses the Tests to Run value in the configuration, as described
> below: []{#popupMenu.execute}
>
> **Box is unchecked (default).** The harness ignores the tests specified in the [current
> configuration](currentConfiguration.html)\'s Tests to Run question. It runs the tests selected in
> the test tree, subject to configuration Test Selection filters, such as keywords. This option is
> compatible with the behavior of test harnesses older than version 4.2.1.
>
> **Box is checked.** The harness compares the tests you selected in the test tree and the tests
> specified in the configuration\'s Tests to Run question to find a set of common tests. The harness
> then applies the configuration\'s Test Selection filters (such as keywords) to the common test
> set, producing the set of eligible tests.

4.  Tests will be executed. The above test selection process and exclusions from the criteria
    defined by the test suite or interview may eliminate all the eligible tests. If this happens you
    will see a message, and the test run is aborted.

## Refresh Test Suite Contents

When developing tests, changes in a test suite are not automatically detected by the harness. The
first time tests are run, the harness uses the test finder to read test descriptions. If the harness
loads tests from an existing work directory, the test descriptions contained in those results are
used by default.

The refresh operation enables test developers []{#testManager.filter} to load changes they might
have made in a test suite without restarting the harness or reloading the test suite.

The harness does not require a work directory to perform a refresh of the test suite.

If you are viewing the test panel after refreshing a test or folder, update the test tree by
choosing a different test or folder icon and repeating your test tree choice.

### Refresh Tests and Folders {#refresh-tests-and-folders .proc}

1.  Select one or more folders and tests in the test tree.

> -   You must left click to select a node. When more than one folder or test is highlighted in the
>     test tree, the Test Manager displays a list of the selected tests and folders in the
>     information area.
> -   Selecting a test chooses only that test.
> -   Selecting a folder chooses all tests currently known to the Test Manager in and below that
>     folder.

2.  Right click in the test tree to open the pop-up menu.

> Opening the pop-up menu is a platform-specific operation (such as right clicking in the test
> tree).

3.  Choose Refresh from the pop-up menu.
    a.  For files, the harness checks the time stamp of the file containing the test description.
        i.  If the time stamp has changed, the harness compares the test descriptions.
        ii. If the properties of the test descriptions are different, the harness removes the test
            result from the work directory and the Test Manager and loads a test containing the new
            test description into the Test Manager and displays it in the Not Run state.
    b.  For folders, the harness checks the time stamps of the files in a folder and scans for new
        folders and tests. This operation may take place on any folder including the root folder.
        i.  If a time stamp has changed, the harness compares the test descriptions.
        ii. If the properties of the test descriptions are different, the harness removes the test
            result from the work directory and the Test Manager and loads the test containing the
            new test description into the Test Manager and displays it in the Not Run state.

[]{#popupMenu.clear}

## Clear Previous Test Results

You can use the Clear Results menu item to remove existing test results for any combination of tests
and folders.

To clear test results, you must have an open work directory.

### Clear a Test Result {#clear-a-test-result .proc}

1.  Select one or more tests in the test tree.

> You must left click to select a node. When more than one test is highlighted in the test tree, the
> Test Manager displays a list of the selected tests and folders in the information area.

2.  Right click in the test tree to open the pop-up menu.

> Opening the pop-up menu is a platform-specific operation (such as right clicking in the test
> tree).

3.  Choose Clear Results from the test tree pop-up menu.

> The harness opens a confirmation dialog box that displays a list of the selected items and
> performs the following actions when the user clicks the Yes button:
>
> -   Removes the `.jtr` file from the work directory for that test.
> -   Refreshes the test description for that test.
> -   Displays the test in the Not Run state.

### Clear Test Results in Folders {#clear-test-results-in-folders .proc}

1.  Select one or more folders in the test tree.

> You must left click to select a node. When more than one folder is highlighted in the test tree,
> the Test Manager displays a list of the selected tests and folders in the information area.

2.  Right click in the test tree pane to open the pop-up menu.

> Opening the pop-up menu is a platform-specific operation (such as right clicking in the test
> tree).

3.  Choose Clear Results from the test tree pop-up menu.

> The harness displays a confirmation dialog box that displays a list of selected items and performs
> the following actions when the user clicks the Yes button:
>
> -   Removes all `.jtr` files from the work directory for all tests in and below that folder.
> -   Deletes all other files in and below the folder in the work directory.
> -   Deletes all other directories corresponding to the folders in and below the folder in the work
>     directory.
> -   Displays the folder and its tests as Not Run.
>
> The harness does not display an error message if it is unable to delete a folder or file from the
> work directory.
