-   View Filters: Enables a warning message that is displayed if the [All Tests
    filter](../browse/viewFilters.html) is selected for a test run.
-   []{#testExecOrder} Test Execution:
    -   Execution from tree popup includes configuration Test to Run setting:
    -   Disable sort of Tests to Run when specified from input file: This allows you to set the test
        execution order. Traditionally tests are run in the order they appear in the main test tree.
        This order is generally determined by the test suite architect. By selecting this option,
        the order execution will follow that in the input file for the Tests to Run section in the
        configuration. That is, the tests will be executed in the order they appear in that file,
        rather than being sorted and then executed. The default state of this checkbox is unchecked.
        See
-   Test Run Messages: Wrap Test Output in the [Test Run Messages
    Pane](../../default/browse/messagesTab.html#messagesTab).
