# GUI Layout

The harness displays the opened tool windows as a set of tabbed panes within a single frame or
desktop.

-   Multiple tool windows are managed from a single location.
-   The small footprint of the desktop minimizes obstruction of tool windows from other
    applications.
-   If multiple tool windows or multiple applications are open, tabs provide visual organization.

Tabs at the bottom of each pane enable you to choose the active pane and to display it on the top of
the stack.

The desktop contains both the desktop menus and the tool menus from the active pane. See
[Menus](desktopMenus.html) for a description of the two types of menus that the harness provides.

See [Setting Preferences](prefsDialog.html) for detailed information about setting display styles
and functional options.
