# Configuration Editor Preferences

To set the default display of theÂ Configuration Editor More Info pane (on the right of the interview
pane), select File \> Preferences, and choose Test Manager \> Configuration Editor. Check the More
Info box if you want the Configuration Editor to show the More Info panel by default, and uncheck it
if you always want it hidden by default.

You can override this preference from the Configuration Editor\'s View menu, however, when the
harness is restarted the Configuration Editor uses this preference as the default.
