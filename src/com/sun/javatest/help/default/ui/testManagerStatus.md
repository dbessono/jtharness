# Test Manager Status Line

The status message line is a resizable text area at the bottom of the Test Manager that displays
information about current Test Manager activity, such as the state of a test run and the name of the
test being run.

![Test Manager Status
Line](../../images/JT4testmgrStatusLine.gif){longdesc="testManagerStatus.html"}

![The following text is a note](../../images/hg_note.gif){longdesc="testManagerStatus.html"}\
If more than one test is running at a time, the Test Manager only displays the name of the last test
started in the status message.
