# Information Area

The Test Manager uses the information area to display information about the item selected in the
test tree. The Test Manager uses two views, folder view and test view, to display the information.

## Folder View

When you click a folder icon in the test tree, the Test Manager displays a Summary tab, a
Documentation tab, five status tabs, and a status field containing information from the work
directory about a folder and its descendants.

longdesc="folderInfo.html"}

The folder view contains filtered summary and status information about the tests in a test folder.
The Test Manager also displays a status message at the bottom of the area about the selected view.
The messages can indicate that tests in the folder are loading or they can provide detailed status
information about a selected test.

During a test run, you can use the folder view to monitor the status of a folder and its tests. You
can also use the folder view during troubleshooting to quickly locate and open individual tests that
had errors or failed during the test run. When a status pane is empty, the Test Manager disables its
tab. This information is displayed in the Summary tabbed pane as values and as a pie chart. The
folder view and test tree use the same view filter when displaying information.

See [Displaying Folder Information](../browse/folderInfo.html) for detailed information about this
view.

## Test View

When you click a test icon in the test tree or double click its name in the Folder view, the Test
Manager displays tabbed panes that contain detailed information about the selected test.
