# Last Test Run View Filter

When you select the Last Test Run view filter, the Test Manager displays the current totals in the
Summary pane and status icons in the test tree for all folders and tests included in the last test
run (even if you have exited the harness since the last test run) or the states from the test run in
progress if the harness is running tests. The information displayed in the Test Manager is
associated with the work directory.

The following examples provide descriptions of the use of the Last Test Run view filter:

-   **Example 1 -** A test run had failed tests and you want to rerun only the failed tests. See
    [Specifying Prior Status](../confEdit/status.html) for a detailed description of setting the
    prior status value. The Test Tree and the Summary pane continue to show all tests in the last
    test run regardless of their status.

> When you repeat the test run, the Test Manager clears the previous test results and only displays
> current status icons in the test tree and totals in the Summary pane for the tests and folders in
> the current test run.

-   **Example 2 -** A test run had failed tests and you want to use an Exclude List in the next run
    that excludes the failed tests from the test run. See [Using Exclude
    Lists](../confEdit/excludeList.html) for a detailed description of specifying an exclude list.
    The Test Tree and the Summary pane do not change when the exclude list is added to the
    configuration.

> When you repeat the test run, the Test Manager clears the previous test results and only displays
> current status icons in the test tree and totals in the Summary pane for the tests and folders in
> the current test run.
