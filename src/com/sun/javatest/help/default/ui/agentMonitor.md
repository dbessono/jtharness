# Agent Monitor Tool

If your test suite uses the harness agent, use the Agent Monitor tool to view all agents in a test
system that are running tests. Choose Tool **\>** Agent Monitor from the menu bar to open the tool
window.

The Agent Monitor window contains two sections: Agent Pool and Agents Currently In Use.

description of using the Agent Monitor tool.
