# Status Information

In addition to Summary and Documentation information, the folder view contains five status tabs that
use the view filter to group and list a folder\'s tests by their results in the work directory. See
[Displaying Folder Information](folderInfo.html) for additional information.

-   In the tabbed panes, click a test in the list to display the summary message at the bottom of
    the pane.

-   By default the list has two columns, Name and Title. Click a heading to sort the list.

-   To display alternate information in the second column, right-click on the column heading and
    make a selection from the Description or Runtime context menus.\
    ![Additional test
    information](../../images/statusAltInfo.gif){longdesc="Additional test information for can be displayed in the second column"}

-   Double click the test name or press Enter to display the test in the test tree and to view its
    unfiltered test information. See [Displaying Test Information](testInfo.html) for additional
    information.
