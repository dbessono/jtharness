# Setting Concurrency with `concurrency`

If you are running the tests on a multi-processor computer, you can use concurrency to speed your
test runs. Use the `concurrency` command to specify the number of tests to run concurrently:

[*\> jtharness*](aboutExamples.html) \... \[*initial-set-up commands*\] \... `-concurrency` *number*
\... \[*task-command*\] \...

See [About the Command-Line Examples](aboutExamples.html) for a description of the use of *\>
jtharness* in the example.

Unless your test suite restricts concurrency, the maximum *number* of threads specified by the
`concurrency `command is 256. See your test suite documentation for additional information about
using concurrency values greater than 1.

When creating a command string to specify the number of tests to run concurrently, include the
commands in the following sequence:

1.  [Set up a configuration](setupCommands.html)
2.  Specify the concurrency value (`concurrency` *number*)
3.  [Include the `runtests` command](runTests.html) (optional).

See [Command-Line Overview](commandLine.html) for a description of the command line structure.

## Detailed Example of `concurrency` Command

In the following example, *myconfig*`.jti` represents a file name that might exist on your system
and value represents a numeric value from 1 to 256 that you might use.

**Command Options Format Example:**

[*\> jtharness*](aboutExamples.html) `-config` *myconfig*`.jti -concurrency` *value* `-runtests`

See [Formatting a Command](formatCommands.html) for descriptions and examples of other command
formats.
