# Command-Line Help

The harness allows you to display the command-line interface in the following forms:

-   All information
-   Topic information
-   Word search information

## Displaying All Information

To display all of the information in command-line help, include `-help all` at the end of the
command line.

[*\> jtharness*](aboutExamples.html) `-help all`

See [About the Command-Line Examples](aboutExamples.html) for a description of the use of *\>
jtharness*.

## Displaying Topic Information

To display only the command-line help for specific topics, include `-help` and the name of the topic
at the end of the command line.

[*\> jtharness*](aboutExamples.html) `-help` *topic name*

The following table lists the available command-line help topics.
