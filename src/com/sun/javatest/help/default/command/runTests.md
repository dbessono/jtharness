# Running Tests With `runtests`

Use the `runtests` command to run the tests specified in the configuration.

[*\> jtharness*](aboutExamples.html) \[*monitor-option*\] \[*setup-commands*\] \... `-runtests` \...

See [About the Command-Line Examples](aboutExamples.html) for a description of the use of *\>
jtharness* in the example.

See [Command-Line Overview](commandLine.html) for a detailed description of the command-line
structure.

You can also use the `runtests` command as part of a sophisticated command sequence that resembles
and functions as a script. You can include command files and multiple commands in the same command
string to programmatically perform repeated, multiple test runs of different configurations without
starting the harness GUI.

See [Using Command Files](commandFile.html) for detailed information about creating and using
command files.

A *monitor-option* can be set in the command line to display test progress information during the
test run. See [Monitor Test Progress Option](verbose.html) for detailed information about setting
this option.

When creating the command string to run one or more tests, include the commands in the following
sequence:

1.  (Optional) Include the command required to monitor a test run.

> See [Monitoring Test Progress With `verbose`](verbose.html) for detailed information about the
> command.

2.  Include the commands required to set up a configuration.

> See [Setup Commands](setupCommands.html) for detailed description of the available commands.

3.  Include the `runtests` command.
