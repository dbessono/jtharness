# Browsing Exclude List Files

Included in the javatest.jar file is a servlet that allows you to use a web browser to view `.jtx`
files.

To view `.jtx` files in your web browser, you must configure your web server to use the
[]{#excludeList4}[]{#excludeList5}JT Harness harness `ExcludeBrowser` servlet.

`com.sun.javatest.servlets.ExcludeBrowser`

Refer to your server documentation for information about configuring it to use the harness
`ExcludeBrowser` servlet. Typically, you configure the web server to direct `.jtx `files to the
servlet for rendering.
