| Question Type                                   | Description                                     |
+=================================================+=================================================+
| Choice Question                                 | This question is used to get a selection from a |
|                                                 | finite list of possible values. For example, in |
|                                                 | the question \"Which protocol would you use,\"  |
|                                                 | where the only possible responses are TCP or    |
|                                                 | UDP. These questions are usually displayed in   |
|                                                 | the Configuration Editor and the Template       |
|                                                 | Editor as radio buttons where you can only      |
|                                                 | select one button at a time.                    |
|                                                 |                                                 |
|                                                 | The following is an example of the format used  |
|                                                 | to set this configuration value in a command    |
|                                                 | line:\                                          |
|                                                 | `set` *My-testsuite*`.cipher 3DES`              |
|                                                 |                                                 |
|                                                 | The value supplied is case sensitive. This type |
|                                                 | of question appears in the Configuration Editor |
|                                                 | as a set of radio buttons or single-selection   |
|                                                 | list of choices.                                |

|                                                 | requirements. The value used is generally a     |
|                                                 | platform specific path. The question may or may |
|                                                 | not check to see that the value is valid before |
|                                                 | it is accepted.                                 |
|                                                 |                                                 |
|                                                 | The following are examples of the format used   |
|                                                 | to set this configuration value in a command    |
|                                                 | line:\                                          |
|                                                 | `set` *My-testsuite.myfile*                     |

+-------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| File List Question                              | If none of the file names have embedded spaces, |
|                                                 | you can use a space-separated list of file      |
|                                                 | names. If any of the file names in the list     |
|                                                 | have embedded spaces, use a newline character   |
|                                                 | to terminate or separate all of the filenames.  |
+-------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Floating Point Question                         | This question is primarily used to enter        |
|                                                 | fractional numbers, but can also accept whole   |
|                                                 | numbers. It might be used to collect values     |
|                                                 | such as a timeout factor in seconds, where a    |
|                                                 | value similar to 1.5 might be entered. It       |
|                                                 | usually appears as a type-in field in both the  |
|                                                 | Configuration Editor and the Template Editor.   |
|                                                 | The question might be set to reject values      |
|                                                 | outside a specified range. See the More Info in |
|                                                 | the Configuration editor or the Template Editor |
|                                                 | for guidelines regarding the values required    |
|                                                 | for a specific question.                        |
|                                                 |                                                 |
|                                                 | The following is an example of the format used  |
|                                                 | to set this configuration value in a command    |
|                                                 | line:\                                          |
|                                                 | `set` *My-testsuite*`.delay 5.0`                |
|                                                 |                                                 |
|                                                 | The value is evaluated using the current locale |
|                                                 | (for example, in European locales, enter 5,0).  |

| Integer Question                                | These questions are commonly used to get port   |
|                                                 | numbers or to specify the number of times to do |
|                                                 | an action. The answers are always restricted to |
|                                                 | whole numbers and might have further            |
|                                                 | restrictions that prevent you from using        |
|                                                 | certain ranges of numbers (such as negative     |
|                                                 | numbers). You might also be restricted to using |
|                                                 | only a particular set of pre-determined         |
|                                                 | numbers. In the Configuration Editor and in the |
|                                                 | Template Editor, these usually appear as plain  |
|                                                 | type-in fields or may be a field which has up   |
|                                                 | and down (spinner) controls to select the       |
|                                                 | number.                                         |
|                                                 |                                                 |
|                                                 | The following is an example of the format used  |
|                                                 | to set this configuration value in a command    |
|                                                 | line:\                                          |
|                                                 | `set` *My-testsuite*`.port 5000`                |
|                                                 |                                                 |
|                                                 | Localized values can be used. For example,      |
|                                                 | 5,000 is acceptable in a US locale.             |
+-------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| IPAddress Question                              | The standard textual representation of the IP   |
|                                                 | Address, as defined by Internet Engineering     |
|                                                 | Task Force (IETF).                              |
|                                                 |                                                 |
|                                                 | A typical IPv4 address string would be          |
|                                                 | \"192.168.1.1\".                                |
+-------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Multi Choice Question                           | This question is used when a selection of       |
|                                                 | choices from a finite set of possible values is |
|                                                 | required from the user. In the Configuration    |
|                                                 | Editor and Template Editor, this question type  |
|                                                 | resembles the Choice question in that it has a  |
|                                                 | list of choices with checkboxes. The difference |
|                                                 | between them is that in a Multi Choice          |
|                                                 | question, you can select more than one          |
|                                                 | checkbox.                                       |
|                                                 |                                                 |
|                                                 | The values that you use in the `set` command    |
|                                                 | must be separated by whitespace (newline, space |
|                                                 | or tab) and must be the absolute new settings   |
|                                                 | for the question. The values that you use are   |
|                                                 | absolute settings and cannot be based on the    |
|                                                 | default or previous value. You must enter the   |
|                                                 | full list of values that you want to turn on    |
|                                                 | (corresponding to the items checked in the      |

|                                                 | representation).                                |

## Using Newlines Inside Strings

When setting values of configuration questions in the command line, the internal command parser
accepts newlines inside strings if they are preceded by a backslash.

Depending on the shell you use, it might or might not be possible to enter this directly on the
command line.

If you want to set values with embedded newlines, create a harness batch command file, and put the
set commands (and any other commands) in that file. In the batch file, you can enter strings with
embedded escaped newlines, as in the following example:

`# switch on verbose mode for commands`\
`verbose:commands`\
`# open a jti file`\
`open /home/user1/tmp/idemo.11mar04.jti`\
`# set a list of files`\
`set demo.file.simpleFileList /tmp/aaa\`\
`/tmp/bbb\`\
`/tmp/ccc`\
`# set a list of strings`\
`set demo.stringList 111\`\
`2222\`\
`3333 `

On Solaris, using the Korn shell, you can simply put newline characters into strings.

Example:

`$JAVA \`\
`-jar image/lib/javatest.jar \`\
`-verbose:commands \`\
`-open /home/user1/tmp/idemo.11mar04.jti \`\
`-set demo.file.simpleFileList /tmp/aaa`\
`/tmp/bbb`\
`/tmp/ccc `
