# Using the `observer` Command

The `observer` command is an advanced command that allows you to register
`com.sun.javatest.Harness.Observer` for monitoring a test run. For example, an observer can monitor
the progress of each test run and implement custom behavior such as sending an email message if a
test in a test run fails. See the API documentation for details or contact the harness team for help
in using an observer.
