# About the Command-Line Examples

This section provides many examples of command-line operations in the following basic sequence:

*\> jtharness* \[*Setup commands*\] \[*Task commands*\]

In the examples, the following presentations are used:

-   *\>* represents the command prompt. For Unix systems, the command prompt can be either a shell
    prompt, such as **%**, or a user defined value. For win32 systems, the command prompt can be
    **c:** or another appropriate drive identifier.
-   *jtharness* represents the command or commands that your test suite would use to start the
    harness.

See [Setup Commands](setupCommands.html) for commands and examples used to set up or change specific
values in a configuration.

See [Task Commands](taskCommands.html) for commands and examples used to perform tasks from the
command line.
