# Specifying Tests or Directories With `tests`

You can specify one or more individual tests or directories of tests for the harness to run. The
harness walks the test tree starting with the sub-branches or tests you specify (or both) and
executes all tests that it finds, excluding tests that are filtered out.

You can use the `tests` command to specify one or more individual tests or directories of tests:

`tests` *path/filename*

See [Command-Line Overview](commandLine.html) for a description of the command line structure.

When creating a command string, include the commands in the following sequence:

1.  Include the commands required to set up a configuration.

> See [Setup Commands](setupCommands.html) for detailed description of the available commands.

2.  Include the commands required to specify tests or directories of tests (`tests`
    *path/filename*).
3.  (Optional) Include a task command such as the `runtests` command.

> See [Task Commands](taskCommands.html) for a description of the available commands.

## Example of `tests` Command

In the following example, *path/filename* represents a file name that might exist on your system.

**Command Options Format Example:**
