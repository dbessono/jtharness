# [Legacy Commands]{#settings}

The command-line interface supports the commands used in previous versions of the harness. In most
cases, using the current commands is preferred, however, if you are running a test suite that uses a
parameter file you can continue to use options in the command line to specify parameter values.
These commands are deprecated and might be removed from future versions of the harness.

See [Using Parameter Commands](parameterCommands.html) for a detailed description of these Legacy
Commands.
