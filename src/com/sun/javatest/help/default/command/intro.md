# Command-Line Interface

There are two harness editions:

-   The *test harness* is a full-featured test system that runs on a computer that has at least the
    resources of a laptop.
-   The *lite harness* provides a subset of test harness features and can run on devices lacking
    some resources required to run the test harness.

The test harness has two interfaces, a command-line interface (CLI), and a graphical user interface
(GUI).

-   The command-line interface provides scriptable test harness functionality for configuring and
    executing tests and creating reports. Information about using the command-line interface can be
    found in the following topics:
    -   [Command-Line Summary](commandLine.html)
    -   [Set-up Commands](setupCommands.html)
    -   [Task Commands](taskCommands.html)
    -   [Desktop Commands](desktopCommands.html)
    -   [Information Commands](displayHelp.html)
    -   [Legacy Commands](legacyCommands.html)
-   The [GUI interface](../ui/usingJT.html) is more suitable for interactive test harness users.

The [lite harness](lite.html) has a command-line interface that supports most test harness CLI
commands except those that activate a graphics component (such as online help).

See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.html) for information about the codes displayed when the
harness exits after running tests using the command-line interface.
