# Monitoring Results With HTTP Server

The harness provides a web server that you can use to remotely monitor and control a test run. The
HTTP Server provides the following two types of output:

-   [HTML-Formatted Output](htmlOutput.html) for users to remotely monitor batch mode test runs in a
    web browser.
-   [Plain Text Output](textOutput.html) for use by automated testing frameworks.
