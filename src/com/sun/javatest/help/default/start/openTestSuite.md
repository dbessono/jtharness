# Opening a Test Suite

You can open a test suite from either the Test Manager or the Quick Start wizard (if it is enabled
and you are starting a new test run).

**Note:** Some test suites do not implement the optional QuickÂ Start wizard. It won\'t be available
if the test suite architect disabled it.

## Open a Test Suite {#open-a-test-suite .proc}

1.  Click the Browse button in the Quick Start wizard Test Suite panel or choose File **\>** Open
    Test Suite from the Test Manager menu bar.
2.  Use the dialog box to navigate to the test suite.
3.  Click the test suite icon or enter its name in the text field.
4.  Click the Open button.

The harness loads the test suite in a new [Test Manager](../ui/window.html).

Before you can run tests, you must open or create a work directory and load or create a
configuration. If you did not use the Quick Start wizard to open the Test Manager, you must perform
these operations separately. See the following topics for detailed information about using work
directories and configurations:

-   [Opening a Work Directory](openDirectory.html) provides information about using an existing work
    directory for the test run.
-   [Creating a Work Directory](createDirectory.html) provides information about creating a new work
    directory for the test run.
-   [Working With Templates](../templates/usingTemplate.html) provides information about using a
    template in the test run.
-   [Creating a New Configuration](../confEdit/createConfiguration.html) provides information about
    creating a new configuration for the test run.
-   [Editing a Configuration](../confEdit/editConfiguration.html) provides information about
    changing configuration values used for the test run.
