# Displaying the Configuration Checklist

Your test suite might produce a checklist of steps that must be performed before running tests. The
checklist is dynamically generated by the harness from the current configuration. Changes to the
values in the current configuration can produce different checklist items.

If the tests suite produces a checklist, the harness enables the Show Checklist menu item. To view
the Configuration Checklist of the current configuration interview choose View **\>** Configuration
**\>** Show Checklist.

To close both the Configuration Checklist and the viewer, click the Close button at the bottom of
the window.
