# Using Bookmarks in Configurations

In Question Mode, you can use Bookmarks to restrict the set of questions displayed in the
Configuration Editor (Bookmarks are not used in Quick Set Mode). Bookmarks are persistent and are
saved in the `.jti` file, and reloaded when the configuration is used again. When bookmarks are
disabled, they are preserved in program memory but cannot be manipulated.
