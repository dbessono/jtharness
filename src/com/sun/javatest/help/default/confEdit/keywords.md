# Specifying Keywords {#specifying-keywords .proc}

![This is the start of a procedure](../../images/hg_proc.gif){longdesc="keywords.html"}To directly
specify the tests that are run, perform the following steps:

1.  Click the ![Quick Set Mode button](../../images/stdValues_button.gif){width="10" height="11"
    longdesc="toolBar.html"} Quick Set Mode button on the Test Manager tool bar or choose Configure
    \> Edit Quick Set \> Keywords in the menu bar.

> The Configuration Editor opens in Quick Set Mode.

> ![The following text is a note](../../images/hg_note.gif){longdesc="quickStart.html"}\
> The harness displays this tab only if your test suite uses keywords.\
> You can use one or more keywords to restrict the set of tests that the harness\
> runs. In Question Mode, use the Keywords question to specify test run restrictions based on the
> keywords.

2.  Click the Keywords tab if it does not have focus.
3.  Click the Select tests that match checkbox.

> The harness enables the Expression, Insert Operator, and Insert Keyword buttons.

3.  Build an expression in the text field by using any logical combination of the following actions:

> -   Click the Expression button to display a list of expressions that can be constructed. From the
>     list, choose the type of expression that you are building. See [List of

> -   Click the Insert Keyword button to display the list of keywords provided by the test suite for
>     use in filtering tests (this is only available if the test suite has information). From the
>     list, choose one or more keywords used in the expression.
> -   Click the Insert Operator button to display a list of logical operators that you can include

## List of Logical Operators

Logical operators are only available when Expression is selected in the list of expressions. The
following table provides descriptions and examples of logical operators that can be used to build
keyword expressions. The precedence column indicates the order in which the expression is resolved.
Expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, with nested parentheses being evaluated from the
innermost parentheses outward.
