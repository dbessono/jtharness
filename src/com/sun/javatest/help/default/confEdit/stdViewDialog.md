# Quick Set Mode

Quick Set Mode uses tabbed panes to display the values of a configuration that the harness uses to
determine which tests are run and how they are run. Because they might change from test run to test
run, the Quick Set Mode enables the user to quickly locate and edit these values.

mode](../../images/JT4configEditorQuickSet.gif){longdesc="stdViewDialog.html"} 

Quick Set Mode displays only the values that apply to your test suite.Tabs containing values that do
not apply to your test suite are not displayed in Quick Set Mode. Depending on your test suite,
Quick Set Mode can display four, five, or six tabbed panes and a menu bar.

-   [Tests](initialFiles.html)
-   [Exclude List](excludeList.html)
-   [Keywords](keywords.html) (Optional)
-   [Prior Status](status.html)
-   [Execution](execution.html)

To use Quick Set Mode, a configuration must be loaded in the Configuration Editor. See [Editing
Quick Set Values](editQuickSet.html) for a description of how to change the Quick Set values of a
configuration.
