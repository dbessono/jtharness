# Specifying Test Environment Files {#specifying-test-environment-files .proc}

Currently test suites obtain configuration values from environment entries in a configuration file
(`.jti`).

For legacy test suites the environment values are read from a test environment file (`.jte`). The
Configuration Editor uses the values from these `.jte` files to build the configuration (`.jti)`
file. Current test suites do not use or support the test environment file.

![This is the start of a procedure](../../images/hg_proc.gif){longdesc="environment.html"}To include
the values from the environment files in the configuration, perform the following steps:

1.  Click the ![QuickSet Mode button](../../images/stdValues_button.gif){width="10" height="11"
    longdesc="toolBar.html"}Â  Quick Set Mode button on the Test Manager tool bar or choose Configure
    \> Edit Quick Set \> Test Environment in the menu bar. The Configuration Editor displays the
    Test Environment tab only if your test suite used `.jte` files to run tests.

> The Configuration Editor opens in Quick Set Mode. The following illustration clips the More Info
> panel.

> ![The following text is a Note](../../images/hg_note.gif){width="18" height="13"
> longdesc="keywords.html"}\
> You can also use the Configuration Editor window in Question Mode to specify the test environment.

2.  Click the Test Environment tab if it does not have focus.
3.  Use the buttons and text field in the tabbed pane to create or modify a list of environment
    files used to run tests in your computing environment.

> See [Files Area](#files) and [Name Area](#environment) for a detailed description of the buttons
> and text field in the Test Environment tabbed pane.

4.  Click the Done button to save the configuration change.

## [Files]{#files} Area

Use the buttons described in the following table to create or modify a list of environment files
used to run tests in your computing environment.
