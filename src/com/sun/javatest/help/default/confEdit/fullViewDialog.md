|                                                 | the extension when it saves the file.           |

Bookmarks menu can be used to specify the questions that the Configuration Editor window displays.

[]{#fullViewDialog.indexPane}

### Index Pane

When completing a configuration, the index pane lists the titles of the questions you have answered,
are currently answering, or that the editor determines might need to be answered. The current
question is highlighted.

In completed configurations, the questions that are displayed in the index can be controlled by
setting bookmarks in the configuration. See [Bookmarks Menu](#fullViewDialog.markermenu).

![The following text is a note](../../images/hg_note.gif){longdesc="fullViewDialog.html"}\
The title is also displayed at the top of the question pane when you are answering a question.

Click on any question in the index list to make it the current question. Clicking on a question does
not cause the list to change. If you change an answer that alters the configuration options, the
Configuration Editor window updates the questions in the list to reflect the change in options. If a
previously answered question is no longer displayed in the index list, the Configuration Editor
saves its answer until you either save the configuration or change its value.

You can also use the buttons at the bottom of the Question pane to navigate through the
configuration file. See [Question Pane](#fullViewDialog.questionPane) for a description of the
navigation buttons.

[]{#fullViewDialog.questionPane}

### Question Pane

The Configuration Editor window displays configuration questions in the main text area of the
editor. You answer the questions using controls such as text boxes, radio buttons, or combo boxes
located beneath the question. After you answer each question, click ![The Configuration Editor Next
button](../../images/confED_nextbutton.gif){longdesc="fullViewDialog.html"}   at the bottom of the
panel to proceed to the next question.

The buttons at the bottom of the Question pane control the following functions:

-   **Back** - Returns to the previous question.
-   **Last** - Advances as far as possible through the configuration.
-   **Next** - Proceeds to the next question.
-   **Done** - Saves your answers as a configuration and closes the Configuration Editor window.

See [Creating a Configuration](createConfiguration.html) for information about using the Question
pane to create a configuration.

See [Editing a Configuration](editConfiguration.html) for information about using the Question pane
to edit the current configuration.

[]{#fullViewDialog.moreInfoPane}

### More Info Pane

To open and close the More Info pane, choose View **\>** More Info from the menu bar.

The More Info pane provides additional information about each question, including the following:

-   Background information about the question
-   Information about choosing an answer
-   Examples of answers

See [Keyboard access](../ui/keyboardAccess.html) for a description of how the keyboard can be used
to navigate the More Info pane.
