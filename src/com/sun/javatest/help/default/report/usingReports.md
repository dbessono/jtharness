# Creating and Displaying Reports

The harness does not automatically create reports at the end of a test run. You must use the harness
to manually create a new report after the test run. You can create and view reports containing the
following test run information:

-   Tests grouped by test status
-   Configuration interview questions and answers
-   Test environment used for the test run

See [Creating Reports](newReports.html) for a description of how to create test reports.

To view reports in the harness Report Browser, choose Report **\>** Open Report from the menu bar.
See [Displaying Reports](reportBrowser.html) for a description of how to view reports.

Because harness reports contain relative and fixed links to other files, you must update these links
when moving reports to other directories. The harness provides a command-line utility for you to use
when moving reports to other directories. See [Moving Test Reports](../command/moveReports.html) in
the *Command-Line Interface User\'s Guide* for a description of how to use the `EditLinks` utility
to move reports.
