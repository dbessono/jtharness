# Displaying Reports

You can use the Report browser or a web browser to display harness reports.

## Display Reports in the Report Browser {#display-reports-in-the-report-browser .proc}

![This is the start of a procedure](../../images/hg_proc.gif){longdesc="reportBrowser.html"} To
display reports in the report browser:

1.  Choose Report **\>** Open Report from the menu bar.

    > The harness opens a file chooser dialog box for you to specify a report directory. When you
    > specify a report directory, the harness opens the Report Browser.
    >
    > ![First page of the report
    > viewer](../../images/JT4reportViewer.gif){longdesc="reportBrowser.html"}

<!-- -->

2.  Choose the report format from the directory listing.

    -   If you choose the HTML format version of the reports, a second directory listing is
        displayed. On the toolbar, you can use the report browser\'s back button (\<) to return to
        the initial report page. You can also click the file name showing on the toolbar to open a
        dropdown of recently visited files and directories.

        ![html page of the report
        viewer](../../images/JT4reportViewer2.gif){longdesc="reportBrowser.html"}

    -   If you choose the text format version of the report, the browser displays a `summary.txt`
        hyperlink to the summary page. The summary page provides a text list of tests that were run
        and their test result status.

        ![text page of the report
        viewer](../../images/JT4reportViewerText.gif){longdesc="reportBrowser.html"}

    -   If you choose the XML format version of the report, the browser displays a `report.xml`
        hyperlink to the XML report page. The XML Report page provides a report of the configuration
        values used to run the tests, the tests that were run, and their test result status.

        This output is for automated processing purposes. It is not designed for human readability.

        ![text page of the report
        viewer](../../images/JT4reportViewerXML.gif){longdesc="reportBrowser.html"}

3.  To see a list of the HTML reports click the Report directory hypertext link.

    ![Report Browser](../../images/JT4reportViewer3.gif){longdesc="reportBrowser.html"}

    Usually you access the report files using the links in the top-level HTML report. You can also
    use the hyperlinks within report.html to display the detailed report files in the report
    browser.

The `report.html` file is the root file that links to the other HTML reports. The `summary.txt`
report contains a list of all tests that were run, their test results, and their status messages.
