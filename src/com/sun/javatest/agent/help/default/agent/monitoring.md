# Monitoring JT Harness Agents

You can monitor JT Harness harness agents in one of the following ways:

-   View all agents in a test system that are running tests. Refer to [Agent Monitor
    Window](window.html) for detailed information about opening and using the Agent Monitor window
    to view all agents in a test system that are running tests.
-   Monitor specific information about an agent and the tests that it runs. To display information
    about the agent, you must use the tabbed panes in the application or applet GUI. See the
    following topics for detailed information about the GUI:
    -   [**Statistics Pane**](statisticsPane.html): Displays the current status of the tests that
        the agent is running.
    -   [**History Pane**](historyPane.html): Displays a list of tasks performed by the agent.
    -   [**Selected Task Pane**](taskPane.html): Displays details about a specific task or test
        chosen in the history tabbed pane.
