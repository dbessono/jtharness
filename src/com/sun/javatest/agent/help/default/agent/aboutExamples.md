# About the Examples

This section provides many examples of the command line in the following basic sequence:

*\> javatest* \[*agent commands*\]

In the examples:

-   *\>* represents the command prompt. For Unix systems the command prompt might be either a shell
    prompt, such as **%**, or a user defined value. For win32 systems the command prompt might be
    **c:** or another appropriate drive identifier.
-   *`JT Harness harness`* represents the command or commands that your test suite would use to
    start the JT Harness harness.

\
![The following text is a note](../../images/hg_note.gif){longdesc="commandLine.html"}\
Start the JT Harness harness from a writeable directory where you intend to create files and store
test results. The command or commands that your test suite uses to start the JT Harness harness must
include the path of the directory \[*jt_dir*\] where the `javatest.jar` file is installed. The
`javatest.jar` file is usually installed in the TCK `lib` directory when the JT Harness harness is
bundled with a TCK.
