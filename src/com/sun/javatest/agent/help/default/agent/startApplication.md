# Starting an Agent Application

Before you can start an agent application, the required classes must be installed on your test
system. Refer to [Installing Agent Classes on Test Systems](loadingClasses.html) for the location
and list of classes required to start the agent directly from the command line or using the
application GUI. Complete the following actions to start an agent application:

1.  Start the JT Harness harness GUI.

2.  Open the Configuration Editor window and configure the JT Harness harness to use an agent. In
    most cases, the window displays detailed instructions about configuring the JT Harness harness
    to run tests using an agent.

3.  If you are starting an active agent, open the Agent Monitor window and enable agent pool
    listening. Refer to [Agent Monitor Window](window.html).

    ![The following text is a note](../../images/hg_note.gif){longdesc="examplesCommandFile.html"}\
    If the agent pool is not listening when an active agent starts, the agent cannot contact the
    harness. The agent returns an error message and then waits until its timeout period ends before
    recontacting the JT Harness harness.

4.  Use the following example to enter the appropriate agent command at the command prompt:

    `java -cp` *classpath* *\[application class\]* *\[options\]*

    -   The `-cp` option sets the classpath required to run the agent. Use the ; or : separator
        appropriate for your test system when more than one class path is included in the command
        string. Refer to [Class Paths](#startApplication.classPaths) for detailed descriptions of
        the classes that your agent requires.
    -   *\[application class\]* sets the class used to run the agent application. Refer to
        [Application Classes](#startApplication.appClass) for a list and description of the classes
        used to start an agent application.
    -   *\[options\]* can be included in the command line to specify the agent parameters. Refer to
        [Agent Options](#startApplication.appOptions) for a list and description of the parameters
        that you can use to configure and start an agent.

    Example:\
    `java -cp /lib/javatest.jar com.sun.javatest.agent.AgentFrame`

    ![The following text is a note](../../images/hg_note.gif){longdesc="examplesCommandFile.html"}\
    You must include the path of the `javatest.jar` file (represented as `/lib/javatest.jar` in the
    example). The `javatest.jar` file is usually installed in the test suite `lib` directory when
    the JT Harness harness is bundled with a test suite.

5.  If you are using the application GUI to run the agent, use the Parameters tabbed pane to verify
    the agent settings and start the agent.

    The following topics provide detailed information about agent parameter settings:

    -   [**Specifying Active Agent Options**](configureActiveAgents.html): Parameter settings
        required to run an active agent.
    -   [**Specifying Passive Agent Options**](configurePassiveAgents.html): Parameter settings
        required to run a passive agent.
    -   [**Specifying Serial Agent Options**](configureSerialAgents.html): Parameter settings
        required to run a serial agent.

## Classpaths

The following table describes the classpaths that are required in the command line.

|                                                 | Some test suites include additional .jar files  |

|                                                 | tests. These `.jar` files must also be included |
|                                                 | in the command string. Refer to [Installing     |

|                                                 | of how agent classes can be installed.          |

The most common error made when setting up a test platform to use an agent is entering the wrong
classpaths in the command string. Configuring your test platform to use the simplest classpaths
increases the reliability of the test run.

#### Application Classes

An application class is required in the command line to run the agent. The following table describes
the two application classes.

+-------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

|                                                 | pressed. Refer to [Agent                        |
