# JT Harness harness agent

An agent is a separate program that works in conjunction with the JT Harness harness to run tests on
a system other than the one that is running the JT Harness harness.

You can use custom agents or the JT Harness harness agent provided with the harness to run tests.
The topics in this section describe how to configure and run the agent provided with the JT Harness
harness. If you are using a custom agent, refer to your test suite documentation for a description
of how to configure and run the agent.

Depending on your test suite, agents are typically used to run tests on small devices that do not
support online help. The *JT Harness Agent\'s User Guide* is provided in PDF format so that you can
use an appropriate viewer to view and print the contents of the JT Harness harness agent online
help.

See the following topics for detailed information about using the JT Harness harness agent:
