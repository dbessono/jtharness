# Using an Agent to Run Tests

To run tests using an agent on a test system, perform the following actions:

1.  Choose the type of agent required to connect to the JT Harness harness.

> See [Choosing the Type of Agent](choosingAgents.html) for a detailed description of active,
> passive, and serial modes.

2.  If required, create a map file for the agent to use in translating strings to usable values.

> See [Creating a Map File](mapFile.html) for a detailed description of map files.

3.  Start the agent. See [Starting a JT Harness harness agent](startAgent.html) for a detailed
    description how agents can be run either as applications or as applets.

    > If you choose to run the agent as an application, perform the procedure in [Starting an Agent
    > Application](startApplication.html).
    >
    > If you choose to run the agent as an applet, perform the procedure in [Starting an Agent
    > Applet](startApplets.html).

4.  Use the agent to run tests.

See [Monitoring JT Harness harness agents](monitoring.html) for a detailed description how to
monitor JT Harness harness agents when running tests.
