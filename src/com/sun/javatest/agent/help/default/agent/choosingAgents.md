# Choosing the Type of Agent

The JT Harness harness agent is a lightweight program compatible with Java Development Kit, version
1.1, that uses a bi-directional serial connection supporting both TCP/IP and RS-232 protocols to
communicate between the test system and the JT Harness harness.

You can use the agent provided by the JT Harness harness if your test system meets the following
minimum requirements:

-   The device supports a communication layer that can last the duration of a test (several
    minutes).
-   The device must be able to have the agent classes loaded on it.

The type of agent that you use depends on the communication protocol used between your test system
and the JT Harness harness and on the type of initial connection made between the agent and the JT
Harness harness. The following table describes the types of agent and the communication protocol.

|                                                 | its timeout period ends. If the timeout period  |
